         5          5          5          5          5          5          5          5          5          5          5          5 
Filling vector with with evenly distributed elements:
         1          2          3          4          5          6          7          8          9         10         11         12

Assigning new values to a slice (using) another slice
         7          8          9         10          5          6          7          8          9         10         11         12 
Testing element-wise multiplication (hadamard multiplication)
Vector 1
         7          8          9         10          5          6          7          8          9         10         11         12 
Vector 2
         0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0 
Result
         0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0 
Sum of hadamard: 0 Should be the same as dot product: 0
All seems to work as expected
Vector with random integers between 0 and 100
        68          8          9         10          5          6          7          8          9         10         11         12 
Vector with random doubles between -1 and 1
    -0.697     0.0756     0.0236      0.549      0.077      0.229     -0.918      -0.13      0.552     -0.725    -0.0753     -0.633 


SECONDLY
Compute 11 function values of the subject function Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x)
x values for training:
        -1       -0.8       -0.6       -0.4       -0.2          0        0.2        0.4        0.6        0.8          1 
y values for training:
     0.353       0.15     -0.456     -0.844       -0.4       0.54      0.961       0.46      -0.29     -0.522      -0.24 

THIRDLY
Initialize neural network with 20 neurons and gaussian_wavelet as activiation.
Now train network with input values, using minimization from homework 13
Iteration steps: 698
response(x= 0.1): 0.87089971238587
subject1(x= 0.1): 0.868850469500733
Ok that worked like a charm.

FOURTHLY
investigating how the number of neurons matter by ploting interpolations.
Writing output files for plottingâ€¦
Training using 5 neurons.
Iteration steps: 783812
Training using 10 neurons.
Iteration steps: 455
Training using 15 neurons.
Iteration steps: 448
Training using 20 neurons.
Iteration steps: 1282
Training using 25 neurons.
Iteration steps: 867
As expected, if the number of neurons the network becomes 'overdetermined' and can sometimes predict strange paths between the input points.
