Homework quadratures PART C:
Now testing improper integrals with one or both limits at infinite delta=1E-06, epsilon=1E-06.
Comparing to Python's scipy.integrate.quad method:


Right limit infinite:

Integrating 1/x^2 from 1 to Infinity using quad with accuracy delta=1E-06 epsilon=1E-06
Result is 1, estimated error is 1.1E-016
Reference value is 1
PASSED
C# quad routine used 4 integrant evaluations.
Python used 15 evaluations

Left limit minus infinite:

Integrating 1/(1+x^2) from -Infinity to 0 using quad with accuracy delta=1E-06 epsilon=1E-06
Result is 1.57079633113225, estimated error is 5.8E-007
Reference value is 1.5707963267949
PASSED
C# quad routine used 352 integrant evaluations.
Python used 45 evaluations

Both limits infinite. Let's try a Gauss distribution:

Integrating exp(-x^2) from -Infinity to Infinity using quad with accuracy delta=1E-06 epsilon=1E-06
Result is 1.77245381326689, estimated error is 4.9E-007
Reference value is 1.77245385090552
PASSED
C# quad routine used 1312 integrant evaluations.
Python used 210 evaluations
