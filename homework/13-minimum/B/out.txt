homework 13-minimization part B:
Fitting Breit-Wigner resonance to CERS Higgs boson data
Iteration start point:
       128          5          1 
Iteration steps: 57281
Mass [Gev/c^2]:    125.97
Width [Gev/c^2]:     2.09
Scaling [arb]:       9.88
Observation: The iteration terminates in the ballbark of the CERN Higgs mass, but if a precision better than 1e-4 is requested the process doesn't conclude in reasonable time.
Writing out list of Berit-Wigner-function values for a plot to visually inspect the quality of the fit.

Conclusion: Inspecting at the plot (higgs_data_fit.pdf) the fit looks acceptable.
