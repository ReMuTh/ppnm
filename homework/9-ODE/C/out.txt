HOMEWORK 9-ODE PART C

Surprising solution to three-body problem
Coding up the dynamics function quite literal, which OK for just three bodies
For more than three it should be done more iterative.

Before jumping to the stable solution, let's see if we can
replicate the more typical chaotic behaviour.

Setting up with initial zero velocity and some positionsâ€¦
Plot three_body_1.svg shows expected erratic trajectories ;-)

Now setting up Carles Simo's initial values Taken from the Chenciner and Montgomery paper.

If we've done newtonian gravitation dynamics right and set up the inital values correctly,
then running the evolution for T=6.32591398 should return the state vector to same position
That is positions and velocity vectors for all three particles

PASSED
Running the evolution for T/3=2.10863799333333 should precisely rotate-permute the particles to take each others place
keeping the data points and plotting them (three_body_2.svg) we see that is indeed the case.
