Testing vector class.
Contructor with no argument returns zero vector
z = 0 0 0

Define two vectors with random integer coordinates between -100, 100
u = 72 9 57
v = 73 -76 61

Vector addition and scalar multiplication:
u+v = 145 -67 118
z+v = 73 -76 61
5*v = 365 -380 305
u*5 = 360 45 285
w = 8*u-v = 503 148 395

Vector dot product:
u • v = 8049

Vector cross product:
u × v = 4881 -231 -6129
[also tests ToString override, as the cross product result is inserted in a formatted string.]

[Test vector compare function]

Test vector compare function. Comparing w to 8*u-v. Should return True True:
True
True

Find single and double precision epsilon in current system:
Double precision epsilon: 2,22044604925031E-16
Single precision (float) epsilon: 1,192093E-07
Crude epsilon: 1E-07

Compare u to u plus the three epsilons added in one coordinate
True
False
True

Compare v to v scaled by (1+epsilons)
False
False
False
