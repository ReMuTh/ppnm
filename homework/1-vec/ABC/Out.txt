Testing vector class.
Contructor with no argument returns zero vector
z = 0 0 0

Define two vectors with random integer coordinates between -100, 100
u = 13 65 -12
v = 82 46 -26

Vector addition and scalar multiplication:
u+v = 95 111 -38
z+v = 82 46 -26
5*v = 410 230 -130
u*5 = 65 325 -60
w = 9*u-v = 35 539 -82

Vector dot product:
u • v = 4368

Vector cross product:
u × v = -1138 -646 -4732
[also tests ToString override, as the cross product result is inserted in a formatted string.]

[Test vector compare function]

Test vector compare function. Comparing w to 9*u-v. Should return True True:
True
True

Find single and double precision epsilon in current system:
Double precision epsilon: 2,22044604925031E-16
Single precision (float) epsilon: 1,192093E-07
Crude epsilon: 1E-07

Compare u to u plus the three epsilons added in one coordinate
True
True
False

Compare v to v scaled by (1+epsilons)
False
False
False
