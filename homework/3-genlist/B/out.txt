Creating genlist of integers

Pushing 8 integers (multiples of 7) to the list:
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 
This genlist has 8 elements and capacity 8

Pushing one more element -42 to the list should double the capacity:
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 -42 
This genlist has 9 elements and capacity 16

Pushing one more element 113, no change in capacity:
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 -42 113 
This genlist has 10 elements and capacity 16

Removing third element, no change in capacity:
7 14 28 35 42 49 56 -42 113 
This genlist has 9 elements and capacity 16

Removing third element again, capacity is halfed:
7 14 35 42 49 56 -42 113 
This genlist has 8 elements and capacity 8

Removing first element, no change in capacity:
14 35 42 49 56 -42 113 
This genlist has 7 elements and capacity 8

Removing element -1 changes nothing
14 35 42 49 56 -42 113 
This genlist has 7 elements and capacity 8

Removing element 10 (larger than size-1) changes nothing
14 35 42 49 56 -42 113 
This genlist has 7 elements and capacity 8
