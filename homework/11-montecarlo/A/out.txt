HOMEWORK 10-montecarlo

Testing plain montecarlo routine

TEST 1:
Let's start out simple and integrate f(x,y) = x*y^2
in the area 0<=x<=2, y<=0<=1, 10.000 samples
Analytical result:  2/3 = 0.6667
Montecarlo Result:   0.6576 ± 0.0078
Deviation from analytical result -0.00907
FAILED

TEST 2:
Let's do a halfsphere. Function that is zero except within the unit circle
where it forms half a unit sphere. Graph looks like a Verner Panton panel from the 1960s
1.000.000 samples in the area -1<x<1, -1<y<1
Analytical result: 2/3*PI = 2.0944
Montecarlo Result:   2.0934 ± 0.0014
Deviation from analytical result -0.00095
PASSED

TEST 3:
The more challenging singular function from the exercise

(PI*PI*PI)^-1 * (1-Cos(x)*Cos(y)*Cos(z))^-1 integrated in 0<x<π, 0<y<π, 0<z<π

For efficiency reasons, there is no reason to calculate the (PI*PI*PI)^-1
factor in every function evaluation, as both output and error estimation
scales with this front factor. So just multiplying it after the fact.
10.000.000 evaluations.

Analytical resuls: Γ(1/4)^4/(4π^3) = 1.3932
Montecarlo result: 1.3875 ± 0.0026
Deviation from analytical result -0.00571
FAILED

Conclusion from the tests is that while the integrations certainly hits in the 
ballpark of the correct result, they often underestimate the error.
