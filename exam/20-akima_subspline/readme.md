Akima spline interpolation
==========================

----------------------

`akimaspline.exe` takes the following arguments

`-input` [string]  
	Relative path input file to read data from that needs interpolating.
	Format is two columns of x y data separated by space
	Must be ordered in incrementing x.
	Must be set for any further processing going on.

`-output` [string]  
	Relative path to the output file in which put interpolated datapoints
	The output file will have four space-separated columns.
	Column 1: x values  
	Column 2: interpolated y-value  
	Column 3: first derivative of the interpolation curve. Calculated using an analytical expression on the cubic sub-spline.  
	Column 4: definate integral from the first x point to the x-value in column 1. Calculated using an analytical expression on the cubic sub-spline.  
	
`-n` [int]  
	The number of interpolation points being put in the output file. Defaults to 101
	(100 interpolation intervals). The first and last being the first and last in the input data

`-z` [double]  
	single x-value for interpolation
	The corresponding interpolated y value and 
	values for the first derivative and definate integral will be returned in the console
	z cannot be outside the limits of x values in the -input file
	
`-endpoints` [string]  
	Which scheme to use for the tangent of the spline on two leftmost and rightmost input points. The options are:  
	* `naive`	Construction the slopes as naive weights on the linear slopes between the three first and three last input points  
	* `akima`	Follows Akimas own suggestion on constructing slopes of four virtual input points, two below and two above the input points  
	* `bica`	Proposed by A.M. Bica this scheme minimises "partial quadratic oscillation in average" of the two outermost splines on either end  
	Defaults to akima.

Optimization efforts:  
1. After reading in the data, the program calculates an array of coarse
accumulated integration areas at the input x values.
The array is kept and makes subsequent integration to interpoint x values faster.
2. The last found binary search interval is kept, and checked as first option
when a new integration point is requested.
If z values all over the place are needed this adds two comparisons extra per point.
However, when a large range of monotonic increasing or desceasing z values is requested
like when writing n consequtive z-values to the output file it saves greatly on computation.
